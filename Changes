        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - Update example app to demonstrate the new basic foreign key support
          added in the last evrsion

        [ BUG FIXES ]

          the JOIN for foreign key values results in ambiguous column names

0.50    2012-02-05
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - New basic foreign key support, allowing you to specify that certain
          columns are foreign keys, and describe which table they refer to, and
          which keys in the foreign table should be used as the key and the
          label, respectively.
        - Use new -auto_pretty_headers option added to HTML::Table::Database so
          that headers in display are automatically made a little nicer (for
          example, "first_name" -> "First Name")
        - Don't throw a warning if DB isn't MySQL.  I've tested this with SQLite
          fairly extensively and it works fine, and it tries to use standard SQL
          which should work anywhere.

0.40    2012-01-16
        - New input_types option, to override the type of input used for some
          fields, if the default choice isn't suitable.

        - New 'downloadable' feature to allow data to be downloaded in various
          formats
        - New 'query_auto_focus' option, to automatically set focus to the
          search field
        Awesome contributions, thanks!

0.20   2011-10-07
        New 'editable' option, for display-only usage - requested a long time

        Documentation fix for editable_columns / display_columns)
         - thanks mlbright (Martin-Louis Bright)
        Allow coderefs to be passed to acceptable_values option (useful if
        you're generating acceptable values on the fly, say, based on another DB
        query)
        Use uri_for() to construct URLs, fixes Issue 15 by jasonjayr

0.10    20111-06-05
        Fix documentation on editable_columns;
        Implement not_editable_columns (was documented, not implemented)
        (ambs)

        Add display_columns setting, to display which columns are shown when
        listing records.  (PR-9 from saberworks - thanks!)

0.05    2011-05-25
        Pay attention to the app's prefix setting.  Thanks to saberworks for
        reporting this (GH-6)
        Fix bug with calling database->quick_update wrongly, preventing rows
        from being updated... silly :|

0.04    2011-05-11
        Avoid uninitialised var warnings if table is empty.
        Thanks to Justin Case in RT #68120 for reporting this and providing a
        patch to fix it - cheers!

0.03    2011-05-09
        Added support to search when in the listing page;
        Code refactoring - thanks to ambs for both!

        Remove dependency on SQL::Abstract, use the convenience methods now
        provided by Dancer::Plugin::Database instead.  Thanks to Jonathan
        Berber for prompting this via RT #68040, reporting that setting
        SQL::Abstract's quote_char to a backtick causes the generated queries to
        be invalid for PostgreSQL.


0.02    2011-03-06
        Discard render_with_layout bodgery in favour of using
        engines('template')->apply_layout().  Thanks to ambs for this.
        Various other bug fixes.

0.01    2010-12-21
        Initial beta-quality release.
