        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Fix uninitialized value errors when re-sorting and downloading
          searches (joshrabinowitz)
        - less cryptic error message when you specify a non-existent table
          (msouth)
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - view route (/prefix/view/:id) (msouth)

0.95    2016-07-21
        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Fix uninitialized value errors when paginating searches
          (joshrabinowitz)

          (joshrabinowitz)

0.94    2015-07-30
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - Note that you should provide your DB config to D::P::D - as a result
          of confusion of a newbie on IRC - thanks for letting me see that the
          instructions just assumed that point was obvious, when it wasn't

0.93    2014-10-29
        [ SECURITY ]
        - Don't repeat search queries back to the browser without escaping, for
          that way lies XSS.

0.92    2014-03-06
        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Make the key_column feature work properly.  Thanks to tobyink on IRC -
          we referred to params->{$key_column} which worked by accident if your
          key column was 'id' (default), but if you'd changed it, it wouldn't
          match the 'id' param from the route.  Also, be more robust about
          looking for params from the desired source.

0.91    2013-07-25
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - New hooks: add_edit_row_pre_save, add_edit_row_post_save (msouth)

        - Foreign keys can now point to a field in the same table (msouth) 
        - Selects can now derive optgroups from acceptable_values  (msouth)
        
        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Added uri_for() around _construct_url() calls that go to browsers
          (helps with Plack::Builder-mounting of apps at prefix).  Use
          use_old_url_scheme: 1 in plugin config if you want the old 
          behavior (msouth)
        - Foreign key join is now left join (helps with nullable foreign keys) (msouth)

0.90    2013-05-04
        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - A few places missed using the Dancer prefix that may have been in
          force at time of route creation, thanks to chenlin rao for reporting
          (chenryn)
        - Let the user supply default values for fields (msouth)
        - Fix bugs causing dependence on D::P::A::E even when not configured to
          use auth (msouth)

0.80    2012-12-12 - the Michael J South release
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - New custom_columns feature, allowing you to transform columns on the
          fly using HTML::Table::Database transformations - thanks to Michael
          (msouth) for contributing this, and sorry it took so long to merge!

0.71   2012-12-06 - the Rahul Kotamaraju release
        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Handle Dancer prefix setting changing after simple_crud() is called
          (reported by Rahul Kotamaraju in RT #73620)
        - Work properly with named database handle - previously, if you supplied
          a named DB connection to use, it would be used in some places but not
          everywhere - there were some naked database->... calls without the
          connection name passed.  This was also reported by Rahul in RT #73620
          - thanks to Rahul for the reports, and sorry the RT ticket sat unseen
            for so long!

0.70    2012-11-28
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - Add new add_edit_row hook which fires just before a row is
          added/edited, so the data can be modified if desired.  Thanks to Rene
          on IRC for the idea.  (More hooks planned in future versions.)

0.61    2012-07-19
        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Fix issue with UTF-8 in the POD

0.60    2012-06-22
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - Update example app to demonstrate the new basic foreign key support
          added in the last evrsion

        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Bug fixes to prevent fiery explosions in certain circumstances when
          the JOIN for foreign key values results in ambiguous column names

0.50    2012-02-05
        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - New basic foreign key support, allowing you to specify that certain
          columns are foreign keys, and describe which table they refer to, and
          which keys in the foreign table should be used as the key and the
          label, respectively.
        - Use new -auto_pretty_headers option added to HTML::Table::Database so
          that headers in display are automatically made a little nicer (for
          example, "first_name" -> "First Name")
        - Don't throw a warning if DB isn't MySQL.  I've tested this with SQLite
          fairly extensively and it works fine, and it tries to use standard SQL
          which should work anywhere.

0.40    2012-01-16
        - New input_types option, to override the type of input used for some
          fields, if the default choice isn't suitable.

0.30    2011-10-18
        New features all kindly contributed by Assaf Gordon - thanks!  :
        - New 'sortable' option to make tables sortable
        - New 'paginate' option to paginate data display table
        - New 'downloadable' feature to allow data to be downloaded in various
          formats
        - New 'query_auto_focus' option, to automatically set focus to the
          search field
        Awesome contributions, thanks!

0.20   2011-10-07
        New 'editable' option, for display-only usage - requested a long time
        ago by @saberworks in Issue 12.

0.11

        Documentation fix for editable_columns / display_columns)
         - thanks mlbright (Martin-Louis Bright)
        Allow coderefs to be passed to acceptable_values option (useful if
        you're generating acceptable values on the fly, say, based on another DB
        query)
        Use uri_for() to construct URLs, fixes Issue 15 by jasonjayr

0.10    20111-06-05
        Fix documentation on editable_columns;
        Implement not_editable_columns (was documented, not implemented)
        (ambs)

        Add display_columns setting, to display which columns are shown when
        listing records.  (PR-9 from saberworks - thanks!)

0.05    2011-05-25
        Pay attention to the app's prefix setting.  Thanks to saberworks for
        reporting this (GH-6)
        Fix bug with calling database->quick_update wrongly, preventing rows
        from being updated... silly :|

0.04    2011-05-11
        Avoid uninitialised var warnings if table is empty.
        Thanks to Justin Case in RT #68120 for reporting this and providing a
        patch to fix it - cheers!

0.03    2011-05-09
        Added support to search when in the listing page;
        Code refactoring - thanks to ambs for both!

        Remove dependency on SQL::Abstract, use the convenience methods now
        provided by Dancer::Plugin::Database instead.  Thanks to Jonathan
        Berber for prompting this via RT #68040, reporting that setting
        SQL::Abstract's quote_char to a backtick causes the generated queries to
        be invalid for PostgreSQL.


0.02    2011-03-06
        Discard render_with_layout bodgery in favour of using
        engines('template')->apply_layout().  Thanks to ambs for this.
        Various other bug fixes.

0.01    2010-12-21
        Initial beta-quality release.
